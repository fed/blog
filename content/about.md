I'm a software engineer with a keen interest in frontend web development, and I help teams ship clean and maintainable code that's
accessible, performant, reliable, and easy to reason about.

This blog has a bit of a focus on web accessibility, Elm, React, functional (reactive) programming, web components, and browser APIs.

I typically post half-baked ideas, thoughts, code snippets and resources that I find interesting and useful. Instead of documenting my
learnings somewhere else, I like publishing them on this blog. That's why you might come across some content that's not really polished or
thorough.

## Colophon

This site was built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and a number of [other packages](https://github.com/fed/blog/blob/master/package.json).

I chose to rely on minimal tooling and web platform fundamentals over heavy libraries/frameworks, keeping things simple and performant. Markup is written in HTML, or generated with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) where templating is needed. Styling is done with vanilla CSS, and any client-side interactivity is written in vanilla JavaScript. All content is written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

The source code for this site is open source and available on [GitHub](htps://github.com/fed/blog) and hosted on
[Cloudflare Pages](https://cloudflare.com).

This website produces less than 0.05 g of COâ‚‚ per per visit, according to
[Website Carbon Calculator](https://websitecarbon.com/website/fedknu-com) and [Digital Beacon](https://digitalbeacon.co/report/fedknu-com),
achieving a carbon footprint rating of A+.

All of the content in this blog is original content written by me, none of it is AI generated.
