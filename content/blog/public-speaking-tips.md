There's no single formula for a great talk, but there is a secret ingredient that all the best ones have in common. TED Curator Chris
Anderson shares this secret — along with four ways to make it work for you.

This is why ideas really matter: if communicated properly, they're capable of changing, forever, how someone thinks about the world, and
shaping their actions both now and well into the future. Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture.

So if you accept that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience, here are four guidelines for
how you should go about that task:

## One, limit your talk to just one major idea.

Ideas are complex things; you need to slash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you're most passionate about, and
give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly. You have to give context, share examples, make it vivid.

So pick one idea, and make it the through-line running through your entire talk, so that everything you say links back to it in some way.

## Two, give your listeners a reason to care.

Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience, you have to get their permission to welcome you in. And the main
tool to achieve that? Curiosity.

Stir your audience's curiosity. Use intriguing, provocative questions to identify why something doesn't make sense and needs explaining. If
you can reveal a disconnection in someone's worldview, they'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap. And once you've sparked that
desire, it will be so much easier to start building your idea.

## Three, build your idea, piece by piece, out of concepts that your audience already understands.

You use the power of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners' minds -- but not your language, their
language. You start where they are. The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar
to their audiences.

Now, metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together, because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern, based
on an idea that the listener already understands. For example, when Jennifer Kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called
CRISPR, she said, "It's as if, for the first time, you had a word processor to edit DNA. CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic
information really easily." Now, a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds.

It's important, therefore, to test your talk on trusted friends, and find out which parts they get confused by.

## Four, here's the final tip: Make your idea worth sharing.

By that I mean, ask yourself the question: "Who does this idea benefit?" And I need you to be honest with the answer.

If the idea only serves you or your organization, then, I'm sorry to say, it's probably not worth sharing. The audience will see right
through you. But if you believe that the idea has the potential to brighten up someone else's day or change someone else's perspective for
the better or inspire someone to do something differently, then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk, one that can be a gift
to them and to all of us.
