This "defaults" list is inspired by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me)'s collection of [app defaults posts](https://defaults.rknight.me), where a huge number of bloggers share their default apps and services. I like how these lists make it easy to find and explore other personal blogs and setups, similarly to what happens with "now" or "uses" pages.

These unassuming and reliable everyday tools are deeply integrated into my habits/routine, and handle life's background tasks allowing me to focus on what actually matters. My approach is to stick with default apps until they can't do what I need, only switching when the built-in option genuinely can't handle my use case.

Still using the [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/mac) browser on my laptop but had to go back to Safari on my phone as some core functionality is still unsupported, e.g. adding events to my calendar from the browser or persistent website blocking via [Freedom](https://freedom.to).
