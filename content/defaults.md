A "defaults" page is a personal inventory of the unassuming and reliable everyday tools that have quietly become essential to our routine. These apps are deeply integrated into our habits, and handle life's background tasks while we focus on what actually matters. My approach is to stick with default apps until they can't do what I need, only switching when the built-in option genuinely can't handle my use case.

This "defaults" list is inspired by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me)'s collection of [app defaults posts](https://defaults.rknight.me), where a huge number of bloggers share their default apps and services. I like how these lists make it easy to find and explore other personal blogs and setups, similarly to what happens with "now" or "uses" pages.
