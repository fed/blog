This page contains a brief overview of what I'm currently focusing on and working towards, both at work and in my personal time, as inspired
by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff) and [the /now movement](https://nownownow.com/about).

Here's what I'm up to right now:

- I'm based in [New South Wales, Australia](https://google.com/maps/place/New+South+Wales).

- I started a new role working with the web platform team at the [ABC](https://abc.net.au/digital-product).

- After sitting the IAAP's
  [Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/cpacc) exam about a year ago,
  I'm now preparing to take the [Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/was-exam) certification exam
  in the next few months.

- I'm currently learning [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) by reading [Elm in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action) and building a
  bunch of examples. I'm curious about Elm's take on frontend architecture, and want to better understand functional programming concepts
  and how they apply to frontend development. I plan to share my experience learning how Elm differs from what I'm used to here on my blog.
