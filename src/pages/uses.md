I love talking about the tools I use every day to get work done and be productive, and I'm really interested in other people's workflows and
setups.

This page is inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com)' project [uses.tech](https://uses.tech), and is my attempt at documenting my
preferred tools and how I do things.

I'm constantly improving and upgrading my setup, especially when it comes to software tools and productivity workflows, so expect this to
change over time.

## Software and services

### Productivity tools

-   [Reminders](https://www.icloud.com/reminders) is good enough for me and does the basics quite well, although there's room for
    improvement. Right now the features I really wish Reminders had are a keyboard shortcut to quickly add tasks without having to open the
    app first, the ability to scroll past the last item in the list (so that I can click on the empty page and add a task easily), the
    ability to hide recurring tasks until the date of the task (or a few days before it's due), the ability to archive projects and also to
    increase the font size or zoom in the whole UI.

-   [Apple Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes) is great for documenting more long term knowledge. Things like recipes, personal goals, or
    just a general brain dump when I'm on the move. I like it also supports using an Apple Pencil to draft notes which is nice when I want
    to take handwritten notes on my iPad. I also think it's great that you can share and collaborate on notes with other iCloud users
    without asking them to sign up to a new service or install any other apps. I looked into many other notes app and for the time being,
    Notes does everything I need and more, and I also like sticking to the defaults and keeping it simple.

-   [Freedom](https://freedom.to) helps me stay focused. I've got a recurrent session on both my laptop and phone that runs on a permanent
    blocklist. If I want to access social media or read the news, I can only do so on my iPad. Messaging applications such as Signal and
    WhatsApp are not blocked on any devices as I still want to be able to reach out to people throughout the day.

-   [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com) for window management, although on my work laptop I use [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com)
    which, at least for my use cases, it's pretty much the same thing.

-   [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) is macOS’ Swiss army knife and a great replacement for Spotlight. I use it for heaps of different things
    including searching for files, listing different timezones, managing clipboard history, text expansion/snippets, unit conversion, emoji
    search and a bunch of automated tasks.

-   [Dato](https://sindresorhus.com/dato) is extremely helpful for staying on top of timezones. Its time travel feature is brilliant and
    helps me with figuring out reasonable times for events across timezones.

-   [Xnip](http://xnipapp.com/) or [Shottr](https://shottr.cc)

-   [PDF Combo](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/pdfcombo/id1030461463) is quite handy for combining PDF files, and
    [Lightweight PDF](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/lightweight-pdf/id1450640351) is useful shall you ever need to compress PDFs. I
    typically use these if I need to submit any government forms/documents when there's a file upload size limit.

### Writing

-   [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) is my go-to application for writing in markdown format. It has a brilliant UI/UX and great features,
    and most of my writing happens here. Definitely one of my all-time favourite tools.

-   [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com) remains, after many years, one of my favourite code/text editors. I still use it mostly for
    notes, got a single `todo.md` file (automatically backed up to iCloud Drive) I use as a brain dump / mental clutter storage where I keep
    random thoughts that pop up half-way through a task, also for things like taking notes during a meeting and so on. Sometimes I also use
    it to edit very large files (it’s very powerful at finding and replacing), to parse and beautify files, etc.

### Coding

-   [Zed](https://zed.dev) as my main editor. For the longest time I've used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and
    [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com) before that.

-   [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) are my preferred tools for all my terminal needs. Before installing
    this last one you need to make sure [zsh is installed and updated](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH#zsh)
    (it should be shipped with MacOS). I also have [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) installed
    for Fish shell-like syntax highlighting, and currently use the [Dracula colour preset](https://draculatheme.com/iterm/).

-   [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for package management, which also installs MacOS' Command Line Tools and [Git](http://git-scm.com).

-   [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is a must for installing and handling different Node versions locally. I install this using
    `curl` or `wget`, as `brew` is not currently supported.

-   [Sublime Merge](https://sublimemerge.com) is quite handy for things like visually parse diffs, navigating a project's history, or
    scanning a list of changes to a particular file over time. For anything else I use Git in my terminal.

-   [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com) is very useful to view all of the HTTP(S) traffic between my computer and the Internet,
    including requests, responses and HTTP headers (which contain the cookies and caching information). It's also extremely useful if you
    need to mock API endpoints to test features locally.

### Security

-   [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) is my password manager of choice. It works well across devices and have never had any problems with
    it.

-   [Duo](https://duo.com) is my 2FA client (runs on my phone only).

### Reading and information organisation

-   [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) is my preferred RSS reader. It works both on MacOS and iOS and syncs over iCloud.

-   [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) helps me track books I've already read or those I want to read. The UI is a bit dated and cluttered,
    but it gets the job done.

-   [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com) is my "read later" service of choice. Its UI is quite simple and minimal, and it works well for
    what I need it for.

-   [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) for creating and reviewing flashcards. I mainly use this tool for documenting vocabulary and grammar
    when learning a new language.

### Miscellaneous

-   [Spotify](https://spotify.com) for streaming and organising my music library, although I also enjoy [brain.fm](https://brain.fm)
    especially when I want to do some focus work.

-   [Loom](https://loom.com) to record videos or demos — it’s a great tool to replace meetings that are not really necessary, and also great
    for asynchronous collaboration across timezones.

## Hardware and furniture

-   [Dell S2721QS (27 inch 4K UHD Monitor)](https://www.dell.com/en-au/shop/dell-27-4k-uhd-monitor-s2721qs/apd/210-axfo/monitors-monitor-accessories):
    Primary 27 inch screen directly in front of me. I only have one external monitor and keep my laptop closed as I like the constraint of
    needing to use a single screen and handling workspaces.

-   [Herman Miller's Aeron Chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_au/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/):

-   Omnidesk: Change between standing and sitting throughout the day.

-   Apple iPhone 15
-   Apple iPad 6
-   Apple Watch 6
-   Apple MacBook
-   Apple AirPods
-   Amazon Kindle: I've got a Kindle where I read my books, which is great for travelling, but lately I've been making use of my local
    library which is a great to still enjoy physical books without the clutter

Apple Magic Mouse & Magic Keyboard The keyboard is an Apple keyboard with a number pad. Works and looks great. I use the swipe gestures for
the Magic Mouse. Apple Magic Mouse 2 is a good mouse with a horrible charging experience.

Notebook (doodling in meatspace)

Away from Work: To keep myself sane, I try to stay away from my laptop after work hours or on weekends, especially while I am traveling. I
take an Ipad (2022 10.2in) during these times, so I can still read the news or play games. I take a Logitech K380 bluetooth keyboard for
when writing inspiration hits; it’s a lot easier than the keyboard on the screen and the keys feel nice and solid.
