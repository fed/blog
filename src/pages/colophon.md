For the website typography, I am using the [Braille Institute's Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/) font
family for all of the text content ("Next" variant) and code snippets ("Mono" variant). This font focuses on letterform distinction, and
it's clear and accessible.

All of the content in this blog is original content written by me, none of it is AI generated.
