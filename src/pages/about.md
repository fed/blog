I'm a software engineer with a keen interest in frontend web development, and I help teams ship clean and maintainable code that's
accessible, reliable, performant and easy to reason about.

This blog is mostly about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with a bit of a focus on web accessibility, React, Elm, browser APIs, web components,
and functional (reactive) programming.

I typically post half-baked ideas, thoughts, code snippets and resources that I find interesting and useful. Instead of documenting my
learnings somewhere else, I like publishing them on this blog. That's why you might come across some content that's not really polished or
thorough.

If you'd like to chat, feel free to flick me an email at [fed@duck.com](mailto:fed@duck.com).
