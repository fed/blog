I'm a software engineer with a keen interest in web development, and I help teams ship clean and
maintainable code. I enjoy working on large scale web applications, and am particularly interested
in accessibility, automated testing and functional reactive programming.

I currently work as a Front End Developer at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com).
