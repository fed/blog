This page contains a brief overview of what I'm currently focusing on and working towards, both at work and in my personal time, as inspired
by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff) and [the /Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about).

> **Last updated:** March 2024

Here's what I'm up to right now:

-   I'm based in [New South Wales, Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales).

-   I work full time on web accessibility at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com).
