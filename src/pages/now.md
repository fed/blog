This page contains a brief overview of what I'm currently focusing on and working towards, both at work and in my personal time, as inspired
by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff) and [the /Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about).

Here's what I'm up to right now:

- I'm based in [New South Wales, Australia](https://google.com/maps/place/New+South+Wales).

- I work full time on web accessibility at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com).
